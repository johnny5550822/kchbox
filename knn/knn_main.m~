%*****************************
% K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is an algorithm which classify an incoming new
% sample by looking into k nearest neighbors of the new sample. For example,
% in a problem of classifying whether an object is an apple or not based on 
% texture and color, if more % than 2 % out of 5 neightbors of the object is 
% apple, then the object will be classified as an apple. 

%****************************
% The flow of KNN is below:

% Step 1: Obtain training data (maybe do some preprocessing)
% Step 2: Define k. k is arbitrary. It can be tuned by cross-validation.
% Step 3: For a new sample,
