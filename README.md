If you have heard about "machine learning" but you don't know how to implement them and how to use them, this is a repository for you. 

On top of that, if you are a fan of Matlab, this repository is definitely for you.

Kchbox contains several standalone implementation of fundamental and famous machine learning  algoirthms, such as KNN, neural network (autoencoder), etc.

This repository is designed for entry-level users who want to get a sense of what machine learning algorithm is. All the algorithms are basic (of course, each of the algorithm has it won advanced version, but it will be too much for a single repository. Just go and get a PhD in CS if you want to know more about a particular algorithm).

Lastly, the algorithms are not fully optimized. Again, this is for entry-level learning. Alternatively, you are always welcome to look into Matlab/Mathwork to look into how each algirhtms work.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me: johnny5550822@g.ucla.edu. 

FYI: I am a big fan of deep learning. I am doing research on application of deep learning in medical images :).
