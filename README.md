If you have heard about "machine learning" but you don't know how to implement them and how to use them, this is a Matlab repository for you. 

Kchbox contains several standalone implementation of fundamental and famous machine learning  algoirthms, such as KNN, neural network (autoencoder), etc.

This repository is designed for entry-level users who want to get a sense of what machine learning algorithm is. All the algorithms are basic (of course, each of the algorithm has it own advanced version. Just go and get a PhD in CS if you want to know more about a particular algorithm).

Lastly, the algorithms are not fully optimized. Again, this is for entry-level learning. Alternatively, you are always welcome to look into Matlab/Mathwork to look into how each algirhtms work.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me: johnny5550822@g.ucla.edu. 

FYI: I am a big fan of deep learning. I am doing research on application of deep convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network in medical images :).
