% To convert a time-series data points into 0 or 1 depending on whether the
% data points belong to decrease or increase

% Input: 1xn, where n is the number of data points
% output: 1x(n-1), because there will be one missing, number of peaks
% (maximum or minimum)

function [new_t,max_peaks,min_peaks] = convertSeriesToBinary(t_s)
    states = [];    % to store binary 0(decreasing) or 1(increasing)
    
    %Define first state
    if (t_s(2) < t_s(1))
        states(1) = 0;
    else
        states(1) = 1;
    end
